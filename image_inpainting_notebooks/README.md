# Image Completion with the CNTK

This directory contains code to compute and apply the CNTK for image completion.  Examples utilizing our codebase are presented in image_inpainting_CNTK.ipynb.  

Some pre-computed kernels are available at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ze142g250n06fys/AAD-u17i5njvBNyztqQjJ4Hba?dl=0

Pre-computed kernels are saved via the hickle library.  Examples of loading and using pre-computed kernels are also provided in image_inpainting_CNTK.ipynb.
